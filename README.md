> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository focuses on REDengine 4 for Cyberpunk 2077. For WolvenKit for <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> please see: https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit-7

WolvenKit is an open-source modding tool for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Our vision is to develop a standalone software which is capable of reading and writing all REDengine file formats. Additionally the WolvenKit application is designed to simplify and accelerate modding workflows. 
This repository was created to demonstrate how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt">CDPR</a>'s proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt#REDengine"><strong>REDengine</strong></a> reads and writes file formats. 

This toolkit is being made solely for research and educational purposes, and the dev team is in no way responsible for any malfunctions that occur from its use.
It's completely open source, licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit/blob/main/LICENSE">GPL-3.0</a>, and in no way is it made to generate revenue.

## Installation

Wolvenkit requires the latest .NET 8.0 runtime:

1. Go to [Microsoft's .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. Find the ".NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.x" section and download the installer for your architecture (x64)
3. Run the downloaded installer

----------

There are multiple ways to install Wolvenkit:

### The WolvenKit.Installer app

The WolvenKit.Installer app is a simple program for managing (installing, updating, removing) different WolvenKit versions similar to the Visual Studio Installer app. 

It is [hosted on github](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit.Installer) and you can install it from there. Click here: [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/WolvenKit/WolvenKit.Installer)](https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit.Installer/releases/latest)

### Portable or Installer

Download either the latest stable version or the current nightly (beta) version from here:

## Credits

WolvenKit is a direct result of the hard work and continuous support, financial and otherwise, of the many researchers, programmers, artists, contributors, and companies that have helped with this project. Without their outstanding work and generous support, we never would have been able to create WolvenKit for Cyberpunk 2077. A very special thank you goes out to...

After Sarcen stopped working on it, a few of us picked it up and continued from there.
