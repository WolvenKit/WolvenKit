# Wolven-kit
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6kdip6nt23gprnnh?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Traderain/wolven-kit)

This repository is created to demonstrate how **REDengine 3** reads and writes file formats and experiment how the game **The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt** works. The whole program is made fully for education purpose we are in no way responsible if your PC or game breaks. This project is completely open source and everyone is free to contribute to it and in no way it is made to generate revenue. It was originally [started by Sarcen](http://forums.cdprojektred.com/forum/en/the-witcher-series/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/mod-discussions/58758-mod-editor) in 2015 when the game originally came out. After he abbandoned the project a few of us have picked it up to continue it. It allows reading and writing nearly every file format by REDengine 3 to some extent. It can be used to create file modifications to the assets of the game. This is far from done so please make sure to check on the project often since it is in heavy development.

## Contibuting:
Please do! Fork the project and please do you changes in small incremental steps with descriptive commit messages. Code quality is not the biggest concern but please don't do stupid mistakes which may lead to the denial of the pull request. Please create an issue when implementing a feature so people don't work on the same feature/issue.
